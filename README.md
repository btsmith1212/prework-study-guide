# Web Development Bootcamp Study Guide

## Description

I wanted to create a study guide for my web development bootcamp course. I built this project as a quick reference guide during my studies. This guide should help anyone who is studying web development to keep track of the different concepts introduced. See the website that I built using these skills.
